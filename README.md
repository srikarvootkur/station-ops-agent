# Station Ops Agent

## Final Goal
A fully autonomous operating system for fuel stations, convenience stores, and future EV sites.  
The system handles pricing, inventory, ordering, reporting, and vendor interactions automatically, with managers only approving or handling exceptions.

---

## Phase 0 — Assisted Operations (8–12 weeks)
Focus: foundation, basic ETL, basic agents, and human approval.

**Outcome:**
- Suggest daily fuel price changes (manager approves)
- Suggest vendor order quantities (manager approves)
- Morning Slack report summarizing pricing, inventory risk, fuel days-to-empty

This phase proves ROI and reduces daily manual effort.

## Phase 1 — Semi-Autonomous Operations
Focus: expand coverage, add more vendors, increase accuracy, reduce manual touches.

**Outcome:**
- Multiple vendor support
- Better inventory inference + shrink alerts
- Automatic competitor feed integration
- Web console for history, config, and overrides
- Some actions can auto-apply if within safe thresholds

---

## Phase 2 — Fully Autonomous Operations
Focus: system acts first, humans review after.

**Outcome:**
- System auto-applies pricing within trusted guardrails
- System auto sends vendor orders except exceptions
- Manager only handles outliers, shortages, breakdowns, or unusual anomalies

---

## Phase 3 — Commercial SaaS Product
Focus: external customers, onboarding other station owners.

**Outcome:**
- Multi-tenant SaaS with role-based access
- Billing, support, audit, and onboarding flows
- Sales playbook for fuel station + c-store automation
- Designed to expand into EV, charging hubs, and travel centers
